= Remaining Up-To-Date

Both the `scripting` package and the exercises can be updated during the course.
It is therefore strongly recommended to subscribe to updates.

Open both these pages:

* https://github.com/ucll-scripting/testing-framework[Testing framework repository]
* https://github.com/ucll-scripting/exercises[Exercises repository]

Press the Watch dropdown button (upper right corner) and select 'Releases only'.
